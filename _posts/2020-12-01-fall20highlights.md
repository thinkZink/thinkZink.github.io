## Fall 2020 highlights:

+ Hospitalized! COVID-positive :(
+ Inspired by my hospitalization to begin medical shadowing and resume hospital volunteering (once available.) Shadowed a doctor in emergency medicine!
+ Продолжала изучать русский и украинский языки. Надеюсь, что смогу использовать эти языки, как только смогу возобновить медицинскую волонтерскую деятельность
+ Taught three fall courses in introductory artificial intelligence and advanced machine learning topics. With students' permission, I would love to connect you with them if you have an interest in technology or research :) Ask them about their final projects -- they should have a spiel ;)

## Talks and papers I've enjoyed:

+ Professor Ailbhe Ní Chasaide (Trinity College Dublin) spoke during Thanksgiving on 'Voice-Prosody and Technologies to Give Voice to Endangered Languages: an Irish Perspective' as part of the Cambridge Linguistics Forum (CLF)
